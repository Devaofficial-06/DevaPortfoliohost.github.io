## Open a Tunnel[¶](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#open-a-tunnel)
[¶](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#open-a-tunnel)
To open a tunnel, use the [connect](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyngrok.ngrok.connect) method, which returns a [NgrokTunnel](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyngrok.ngrok.NgrokTunnel), and this returned object has a reference to the public URL generated by ngrok in its [public_url](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyngrok.ngrok.NgrokTunnel.public_url) attribute.

```
connect
```


```
NgrokTunnel
```


```
ngrok
```


```
public_url
```


```
from pyngrok import ngrok # Open a HTTP tunnel on the default port 80 # <NgrokTunnel: "https://<public_sub>.ngrok.io" -> "http://localhost:80"> http_tunnel = ngrok.connect() # Open a SSH tunnel # <NgrokTunnel: "tcp://0.tcp.ngrok.io:12345" -> "localhost:22"> ssh_tunnel = ngrok.connect("22", "tcp") # Open a named tunnel from the config file named_tunnel = ngrok.connect(name="my-config-file-tunnel") # Open an Internal Endpoint that's load balanced # <NgrokTunnel: "https://some-endpoint.internal" -> "http://localhost:9000"> internal_endpoint = ngrok.connect(addr="9000", domain="some-endpoint.internal", pooling_enabled=True)
```

The [connect](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyngrok.ngrok.connect) method takes kwargs as well, which allows you to pass additional tunnel configurations that are supported by ngrok (or the name of a tunnel defined in ngrok’s config file), [as documented here](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#tunnel-configurations).

```
connect
```


```
kwargs
```


```
ngrok
```


```
name
```


```
ngrok
```

Note
ngrok v2’s default behavior for http when no additional properties are passed is to open two tunnels, one http and one https. pyngrok’s [connect](https://pyngrok.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pyngrok.ngrok.connect) method will return a reference to the http tunnel in this case. If only a single tunnel is needed, pass bind_tls=True and a reference to the https tunnel will be returned.
